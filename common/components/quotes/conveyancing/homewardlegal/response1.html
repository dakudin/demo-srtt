        <p>One of the most common concerns about the conveyancing process is the length of time it can take.</p>
        <p>Homeward Legal is sensitive to this issue and our solicitors are among the fastest and most proactive in the country. </p>
        <p>We work hard to meet your preferred timescale.  The conveyancing process does involve a number of parties, including lenders, buyers, sellers, managing agents and other solicitors. Any of the these parties has the potential to cause a delay. Homeward Legal solicitors work aim to reduce and prevent any such delays through proactive communication.</p>
        <p>Although there are no guarantees when it comes to completion time frames, we do everything we can to move you faster.  However there is much you can do to help speed up the process. </p>
        <p><b>Tips for a faster property sale</b></p><ul><li>Complete all of the conveyancing forms as quickly as you possibly can</li><li>Choose a solicitor who uses email as a primary method of communication</li><li>Consider instructing a (no move no fee) solicitor before you find a buyer</li><li>Lay your hands on as many documents relating to warranties e.g. FENSA, planning permissions, building regulations, electrical certificates etc and give these to your solicitor ASAP</li></ul>
        <br />
        <p><b>...and if the property is leasehold: </b></p>
        <p>The most common delaying factor in completing on a leasehold property is the wait for the Management Information. Unfortunately freeholders and managing agents are not motivated to act quickly and it can take weeks or even months for them to provide the necessary information. </p>
        <p>So the most important tip is to apply for management information as early as possible, even before you market the property.</p>
        <p><b>Tips for a faster property purchase: </b></p><ul><li>Ensure you have any finance arranged as early as possible</li><li>Ask you solicitor to apply for the fastest searches.  Sometimes these will be personal searches and sometimes official searches</li></ul>
        <br />
        <p><b>What we do to speed things up:</b></p>
        <ul><li>Identify blockages in the chain and push to resolve issues</li><li>Make sure our solicitors don't handle too many files so they have time for you</li><li>Use email in preference to snail mail</li><li>Give you the direct contact details of your solicitor so you can raise any issues directly</li><li>Use state of the art technology to manage your case</li></ul>

                <p>Homeward Legal believe that the price you are quoted is the price you should pay when you move.</p>

<p>Many firms charge additional fees over and above what they quote. &nbsp;Often these 'additional fees' are actually routine parts of the standard conveyancing process, and as such no such fee should be charged.</p>

<p>The following table gives example of the sort of additional fees some firms charge, all of which Homeward Legal include with your quote:</p>
